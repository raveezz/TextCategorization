Over the past five years, home consoles have experienced a revolution in high-quality tennis games, thanks to titles such as Virtua Tennis, Sega Sports Tennis 2K2, and Top Spin.

For starters, WCT is plagued with flat scenery, egregiously bad character models, an oddly overcomplicated control scheme, a featureless two-player singles game, and a tepid, monotonous career mode. To make matters worse, the game is riddled with bugs. For example, it’s entirely possible to wander over to your opponent’s side of the court midgame—and if you’re lucky, he might even stop moving altogether, prompting you to restart the entire match. This is, of course, in addition to other game-crashing and machine-rebooting bugs.
