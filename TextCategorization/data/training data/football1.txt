College football is American football played by teams of students fielded by American universities and colleges, including United States military academies. It was the venue through which American football first gained popularity in the United States. College football remains extremely popular today among students, alumni, and other fans of the sport. College football is also used to refer to Canadian football played Like other modern codes of football, modern American football has its origins in various games, all known as "football", played at elite schools in England in the mid-19th century. By the 1840s, students at Rugby School in England were playing a game in which players were able to pick up the ball and ran with it, a sport later known as Rugby football (or rugby). The game was taken to Canada by British soldiers stationed there, and was soon being played at Canadian colleges.
However, the first game played between teams representing American colleges was played under rules more similar to the 1863 rules of the English Football Association, the basis of the modern form of soccer. The game, between Rutgers University and Princeton University, took place on November 6, 1869 at College Field (now the site of the College Avenue Gymnasium), New Brunswick, New Jersey. Rutgers won, by a score of 6 "runs" to 4. Other colleges followed suit and — for a short time — soccer became the dominant code of "football" at U.S. colleges.
The American experience with rugby-style games began in 1874 at a meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts between Harvard University and Montreal, Quebec's McGill University. The McGill team played a rugby-style game, while Harvard was isolated from other U.S. colleges by the fact that it played under rules which allowed greater handling of the ball than soccer. The teams agreed to play under compromise rules. The Harvard students took to the rugby rules and adopted them as their own.
