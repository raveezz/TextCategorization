Worse still for Cameroon supporters was that they were then knocked out of the Nations Cup in the quarter-finals by the Ivorians on penalties. 

Nine Africans have won Europe's most prestigious club trophy in its various formats, with the competition having changed from the European Cup to the Champions League in 1992. 

The first was Zimbabwean goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar who lifted the trophy with Liverpool in 1984, followed three years later by Algeria's Rabah Madjer with FC Porto. 

Ghana's Abedi Pele won the competition with French side Marseille in 1993, while other Africans who followed him are Nigerian pair Finidi George and Nwankwo Kanu (Ajax, 1995) and Cameroon's Geremi (Real Madrid, 2000). 

Another Ghanaian, Sammy Kuffour, lifted the trophy with Germany's Bayern Munich in 2001, before Benni McCarthy became the first South African winner in 2003 as FC Porto won the competition again. 

 Traore in Euro glory  

The last African to win the Champions League final was Mali's Djimi Traore, who will never forget Liverpool's dramatic triumph over Milan in Istanbul last year.

Didier Drogba grabs his second English title 

Ghana's Michael Essien, Cameroonian Geremi Njitap and the Ivory Coast's Didier Drogba are celebrating after winning the English Premiership title with Chelsea on Saturday. 

The West London club took their second consecutive championship with a 3-nil win over Manchester United. 

At the other end of the Premiership table, there was a first ever goal for the much-maligned Zimbabwean striker Benjani Mwaruwari. 

His first ever goal for Portsmouth was cancelled out a strike by Senegal's Henri Camara for Wigan. 

Portsmouth went onto to win the game 2-1 a result that kept them in the Premiership for next season.
