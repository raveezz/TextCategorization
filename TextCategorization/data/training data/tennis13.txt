Top seed Rafael Nadal has progressed into the third round of the Barcelona Open with a comfortable straight sets victory over countryman Feliciano Lopez 6-4, 6-2.

The defending champion, who is coming off a title at the Monte Carlo Masters, claimed a competitive first set before dropping a break early in the second. Yet the Spanish prodigy rallied to claim three service breaks stretching his unbeaten run on clay to 43.

Nadal said he expected the opening rounds to be a struggle. "I know from experience that the first two rounds are very difficult," Nadal told the BBC. “I know that if I can win the first two rounds then it gets a bit easier after that."

Nadal joins former Barcelona champions and Spaniards Tommy Robredo, Juan Carlos Ferrero and Albert Costa in the third round.

Spaniard Albert Costa has progressed to the third round of his hometown and final tournament on the back of blistering victories over highly rated opponents in Vince Spadea and eighth seed Dominik Hrbaty.

Pre-tournament the 31-year-old announced that the Barcelona Open would be his final event; ironically the wildcard entrant may be experiencing his best form for years.

Costa battled trough a first round marathon against American Spadea, outlasting his opponent in just under three hours 7-6 (5), 4-6, 6-1 in what was his first tour win since August 2006.

The former French Open champion then backed up in front of a passionate home crowd to upset highly ranked Hrbaty 6-3, 7-5 making the most of his opportunities to convert all three of his break point opportunities.

Costa now faces the challenge of 10th seeded clay court specialist Juan Carlos Ferrero who defeated compatriot Alberto Martin 6-4, 7-6(1). However if Costa can continue such form combined with the influence of his home crowd, he may further delay his fairytale ending.
