The length of the season has gradually increased over the course of the game's history. In spring 2005, the NCAA ruled that teams could schedule twelve regular-season games (up from eleven) beginning in the 2006 season. This decision was met with some criticism from those who claimed that expanding the season would overwork the athletes.
In the spring, many colleges stage a scrimmage between their offensive and defensive players. The spring game generally comes at the conclusion of spring practice.

Rules
Although rules for the high school, college, and NFL games are generally consistent, there are some differences. The NCAA determines the regulations for Division I, I-AA, II, and III games (The NAIA is a separate organization). Some unique rules are:
•	A pass is ruled complete if one of the receiver's feet is inbounds at the time of the catch. In the NFL, both feet must be inbounds. 
•	A player is considered down when any part of his body other than the feet or hands touches the ground. In the NFL a player is active until he is tackled by a member of the opposing team (Down by contact). 
•	The game-clock is stopped when a first down is achieved, until the first-down markers are moved to the new line of scrimmage. 
•	When a game goes to overtime, each team is given one possession from its opponent's twenty-five yard line. The leader after those possessions, if there is one, is declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, this continues, switching the order of possessions for each overtime, until one team leads the other at the end of the overtime. Extra points do not count from the 3rd overtime on, making it necessary for teams scoring touchdowns to attempt a two-point conversion. (In The NFL, overtime is decided by a 15-minute sudden-death quarter.) 
•	Two-point conversions are attempted from the three yard line. The NFL uses the two yard line.

Globalisation is a popular buzzword at the moment. When you hear it, maybe you think of economic theory (you need to get out more). Maybe you think of the anti-globalisation riots that follow the G7 meetings from city to city (you need to calm down). But globalisation is not just a fancy economic theory. In its everyday incarnation, 'globalisation' means fewer trade barriers, and a blurring of the dividing line between the national and the international. It implies a 'global' approach (you don’t say) that treats the world as one big single market, and when followed through, the differences between countries also seem smaller. Improvements in technology and the opening of markets mean that globalisation permeates into all walks of life, even football. Yes, football. You don’t think so? Read on… 
Football is the most popular sport in the world, with over 200 countries affiliated to the governing body, FIFA. The FIFA World Cup is the most popular sports event in the world, and in 2002 the finals in Japan and Korea were broadcast to over 1.8 billion viewers. Football is now a global brand, and this has lead to changes in the way the game is played, owned and run. 
Let’s start by looking at some of the changes on the pitch. It’s fair to say that there have been no significant changes to the rules of association football over the past few decades. The offside rule has been tweaked a bit, and there have been changes regarding goalkeepers handling pass-backs from their own team, but these have not fundamentally altered the flow of the game (unless you’re David James). However some of the rules governing the running of football have changed, and have made it easier for players to move between teams.
