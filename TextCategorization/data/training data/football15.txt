The main question though is whether a tenth African will win, or an eleventh as well, when Europe's finest clubs meet on 17 May. 

For should Arsenal's Gunners fire themselves to glory in the home town of French striker Thierry Henry, then the Ivorian duo of Kolo Toure and Emmanuel Eboue are more than likely to pick up winners' medals. 

Togo's Emmanuel Adebayor cannot play in the final for Arsenal since he is cup-tied, having represented Monaco in this season's Champions League. 

 Toure goal sinks Villareal  

Toure has been one of the Premiership's most consistent players this season, putting in a succession of solid performances as Arsenal have used European success to make up for domestic disappointment. 

The 22-year-old Eboue meanwhile has risen from nowhere to become an integral component of the Arsenal back four. 

Many Gunners supporters now wonder whether Cameroon's Lauren will return to the right back spot when he recovers from a long-term knee injury. 

Eboue has come of age in 2006, performing well for Nations Cup runners-up Ivory Coast earlier this year before turning in fine performances in Madrid and Turin en route to Paris. 

Arsenal have now gone ten matches without conceding a goal in the Champions League, which will present Barcelona's Samuel Eto'o with a challenge he will relish. 

 
Bruce Grobbelaar was the first African to win the European Cup 

The Cameroonian is the only African at the Catalan club but is a key figure, leading La Liga's scoring charts with 24 goals. 

Although Eto'o's main focus will be winning the Champions League for the first time as a player, another sub-plot will be bubbling away.
