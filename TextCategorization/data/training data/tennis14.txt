Argentine third seed Guillermo Coria has been wiped out in the third round of the Barcelona Open after capitulating at the hands of Spanish rising star Nicolas Almagro, while countryman Albert Costa has played his last professional tennis match.

The highly credentialed Coria served an astonishing 14 double faults and was comprehensively outplayed en-route to a 6-0, 6-2 loss. Almagro, whose stellar clay court season continues after he took out the Valencia title last month, took apart Coria’s game in just 52 minutes, taking five out of his six break point opportunities.

Meanwhile Almagro’s countryman and tenth seed Juan-Carlos Ferrero effectively ended the career of veteran former French Open champion Albert Costa, who in front of an adoring home-crowd put up a reasonable fight to eventually lose 6-3, 6-2. The loss permanently ends the 31-year-olds purple patch of form, as he had knocked out big names such as Vince Spadea and Dominik Hrbaty on the way to his third round exit.

Switzerland’s Stanislas Wawrinka was another to cause an upset, coming back from a set down to eliminate fifth seed David Ferrer 1-6, 6-3, 6-2. Wawrinka will now advance into the quarter-finals where he will meet Croatian giant Ivo Karlovic who won a hard fought battle against impressive Russian qualifier Evgeny Korolev 6-7 (4), 7-6 (4), 7-6 (5).

Others to progress include World No. 2 Rafael Nadal who easily took care of Ivan Navarro Pastor 6-4, 6-2, fourth seed Radek Stepanek who outlasted Paul-Henri Mathieu 1-6, 6-3, 6-2, and seventh seed Jarkko Nieminen who wiped out Spaniard Alberto Portas.
