1982 Semifinals: 

West Germany 3 France 3 

(at ET; West Germany 

won 5-4 on penalties) 

A World Cup classic, which became the first match in the competition to be settled by a penalty shoot-out. France provided most of the early excitement but fell behind to Pierre Littbarski's volley. A foul on Dominique Rocheteau in the box allowed Michel Platini to level the scores in the 26th minute. The second half featured no more goals but did include one of the World Cup's most notorious acts of thuggery as West Germany's goalkeeper Harald `Toni' Schumacher clattered into the advancing Patrick Battiston, shattering the French substitute's vertebrae. Dutch referee Charles Corver did not even award the incensed French a free-kick, let alone book or send off Schumacher. Marius Tresor crashed in France's second goal two minutes into extra-time and the game looked to have been settled when Alain Giresse struck from the edge of the penalty area. But the Germans' renowned powers of recovery were in evidence again as Karl-Heinz Rummenigge pulled one back before half-time of the extra period. Klaus Fischer's overhead kick forced penalties, and Jupp Derwall's men were spot-on as Schumacher — lucky to still be on the pitch — made the decisive save from Didier Six. 

1986 Quarterfinals: 

France 1 Brazil 1 (at ET; 

France won 4-3 on penalties) 

France overcame their 1982 disappointment by winning the 1984 European Championships in style, and their confrontation with Brazil in Mexico was a pulsating contest between two teams loaded with flair players. 

Careca blasted in the first goal after a typically smart move but France equalised when a Rocheteau cross from the right eluded both France striker Yannick Stopyra and Brazil goalkeeper Carlos and Michel Platini tapped into an empty net. Substitute Zico had the chance to win it from the penalty spot but his effort was saved by Joel Bats. That miss ultimately resulted in a shoot-out, which despite a miss from the inspirational Platini, France won to set up another semifinal meeting with West Germany.
