Middlesbrough goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer played an important role in securing Australia's first World Cup appearance since 1974. Australians are hoping that Schwarzer recovers in time for the World Cup from the fractured cheekbone he suffered during Boro's FA Cup semifinal defeat against West Ham. Schwarzer's stability will help him in the World Cup; he is now settled again at Boro, where he is the longest-serving player, after considering a move away from the club earlier in the year. 

Schwarzer, regarded as a fine shot-stopper, was born in Sydney to German parents and began his footballing career with the Marconi Stallions club in his home city. In 1994 he moved to his parents' homeland and joined Dynamo Dresden. He quickly caught the eye, moving to Kaiserslautern the following summer and just a year later he was snapped up by Bradford City for GBP35,000. 

His rapid ascent continued and he had little time to settle in West Yorkshire as he was picked up by Premier League club Middlesbrough in a GBP1.5 million deal after just four months in England. He has truly established himself on Teesside, serving the club with distinction since arriving in February 1997. 

Schwarzer committed himself fully to the club and made himself unavailable for Australia selection to concentrate on his career at The Riverside Stadium. He reversed that decision in 2000 and has since become the Socceroos' first-choice goalkeeper succeeding Mark Bosnich.
