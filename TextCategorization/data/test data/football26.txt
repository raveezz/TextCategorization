Scotland look like they've got a pretty terrible draw, but as a Scot I'm looking for chinks of light and I'm not as disappointed as I might have been a couple of years ago with the prospect of facing France, Italy and the Ukraine.
For a start, although it's a long shot, I think Walter Smith will give us a far greater chance of getting out of that group than Berti Vogts ever would. Having Walter in charge gives me a lot more optimism indeed.
And although we have France and Italy, this is not the France of 1998, this is the France of 2006 - and this version does not sweep all before them. And there are not too many fantastic Italian players around anymore, most of the best players in their league are foreigners.
Okay, I might be clutching at straws a little bit, but it's fair to say that although they are massive names in world football, they are not the powers they once were. I don't think either of those countries will dominate this group.
Each team's got 12 games to play, and nobody's going to get 36 points, so I'd say we're looking at a benchmark of 25-28 points to qualify. Scotland can beat anyone at home on their day so there's 18 points to play for there. Okay, it's a huge ask, but you have to set your stall out and believe it's possible.
The big worry for me is not playing France or Italy but the smaller nations. It would be just like Scotland to pull off draws against the big countries but mess it all up at home against Georgia or Lithuania. Those are the kind of fears you have as a Scottish fan.
I just hope that we make a good fist of it, that we compete properly and are not the fall guys of the group. I'm confident we won't be - we could have beaten Italy at home last time if not for a really late goal, and they needed two free-kicks to beat us in Italy. We're certainly not going to roll over.
Some Scots will be irked that England seem to have got an easy draw, but we're coming out of a low pot and have to expect a difficult draw. It's up to us to get back up to the third pot at least, and that's a process that will happen slowly but surely under Walter.
Of all the teams in a relegation battle - and they are in a relegation battle - Middlesbrough are probably in the poorest form bar anyone but Sunderland. They have not won a Premiership game since November, and that's incredible considering the talent they have at their disposal.
I know they've had injuries, but they've gone from the sublime to the ridiculous this season. How can a team that can beat Arsenal and Man United then go into such a poor run of form that they find themselves just one place above the relegation zone?
