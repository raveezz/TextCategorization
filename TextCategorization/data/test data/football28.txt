I have two words for anyone who says that Bolton should give up their so-called 'ugly football' and play a prettier version: Birmingham City.
Steve Bruce got Birmingham where he did with players like Robbie Savage doing the dirty things well, making them very difficult to play against. He then tried to bring in quality and improve the standard of football and they are in an awful mess.
His Birmingham side are in the relegation zone and Bruce knows he needs to get ugly again, to get back to what got them in the Premiership in the first place, while Sam Allardyce's Bolton are in the top eight and people are critising him for playing that way. It sounds crazy doesn't it?
And I don't remember Martin O'Neill getting a lot of stick for basically managing the same way at Leicester, leading a limited side to success with no-nonsense players like Gerry Taggart and Matt Elliott at the back and a big bloke like Emile Heskey up front.
Sam should not be giving a monkey's what anyone else thinks - including Alan Green - as long as he continues to lead Bolton to success and please the fans. Those are the two things he needs to achieve and at the moment he's doing that with his tactics. You should be careful what you try and change, as Bruce now knows.
He won't thank me for saying this but Bolton are like the modern-day Wimbledon, they bloody the big teams' noses by making it so difficult for them to play, and that's not comfortable for the purists, who think that football should be played their way.
What a boring league we would have if everyone played the same way, if everyone tried to walk the ball into the net like Arsenal or played a quick-breaking 4-3-3 like Chelsea. Football is all about variety and if you don't like the way that Bolton play, just don't watch them.
I'm not a great lover of the 4-5-1 system that Sam uses, but I am a big lover of using the resources that you've got to the greatest effect. They don't have Thierry Henry or Wayne Rooney, they have Kevin Davies. You have to play to your strengths.
They mix it up. They don't mess about in defence and they can get the ball forward and into dangerous areas quickly. But they can also string passes together and get through defences with more intricate football. You can't get where Bolton are in the table by purely lumping it forward, but you can't blame them for using the quickest route sometimes when it's effective.
Bruce would certainly like a little bit of that Bolton attitude in his team at the moment as they have had an absolutely rotten start to the season. He'd certainly take a description of 'ugly' if it meant that they got some points and moved up that table.
