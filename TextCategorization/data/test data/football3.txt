Schwarzer committed himself fully to the club and made himself unavailable for Australia selection to concentrate on his career at The Riverside Stadium. He reversed that decision in 2000 and has since become the Socceroos' first-choice goalkeeper succeeding Mark Bosnich. 

Schwarzer had a difficult start at Boro, suffering immediate relegation and breaking a leg. He lost his place in the Boro side but soon returned to help the club back into the top flight and he has been almost a permanent fixture since, injuries aside. 

The Aussie won his first winners' medal in 2004 as Boro beat Bolton in the Carling Cup final. They have played in the UEFA Cup in the two seasons since, and are in the final this year against Seville, which unfortunately Schwarzer will miss because of his fractured cheekbone. 

The injury might well lead to the Aussie goalkeeper's lowest point in football. The 33-year-old's collision with Hammers forward Dean Ashton at Villa Park means that he is struggling to be fit by the time the World Cup starts in Germany, although initial reports suggest that his recovery should take around a month and therefore he might just be able to make the big one. Schwarzer married wife Paloma in 1998 and they have two children, Julian and Amaya. They live together in the affluent North Yorkshire town of Harrogate. 

Schwarzer speaks German and Spanish as well as English and lists deep-sea fishing among his hobbies. He admits he is superstitious and has worn the same pair of shin pads since he was 19. The Aussie is the owner of two cars, a Volkswagen Touareg and a Land Rover Discovery. The Touareg costs between GBP28,000 and GBP50,000 depending on the model. The Discovery prices start at GBP26,995 for the TDV6 five-seater and rise to GBP46,995 for the top-range V8 HSE 7-seater.
