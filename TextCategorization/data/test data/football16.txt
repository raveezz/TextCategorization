Two teams with great pedigree, Argentina and England would be travelling to Germany, shouldering the vast expectations of their legion of fans in their respective countries and elsewhere. While Argentina would be aiming for a third title after the sweet successes in 1978 and 1986, England has a more onerous task on hand as it seeks to put the record straight since its only triumph in 1966 on home soil under the leadership of the classy Bobby Moore. 

In 2002, when Japan and South Korea jointly hosted the prestigious event, the two teams were drawn in the same group. But in Germany 2006, they are pooled in different groups for the preliminaries — England finds itself alongside Sweden, Paraguay and debutants Trinidad & Tobago in Group B, while Argentina will battle it out with Holland, Ivory Coast and Serbia & Montenegro in Group C. 

Yet, given the proven track record of the two in the quadrennial extravaganza, it does seem as if the Argentinians are better placed to go all the way. Though it is true that the side is yet to emerge from the shadow of the legendary Diego Maradona, Argentina should still figure among the select band of favourites; its status unaltered by its poor showing four years ago and the failure of the two-time champion to top the ten-team South American qualifiers for the first time since 1994. 

The qualifying campaign had proved somewhat of a roller-coaster ride for the Argentinians. They found some of the much-needed solidity and consistency after a poor beginning, before the unexpected resignation of the team coach, Marcelo Bielsa, threatened to blow them off course. However, the ship was steadied quickly by the newly appointed Jose Pekerman before the Argentinians became the first South American team to make it to Germany 2006 with as many as three rounds to spare and with a peach of a win against old foes Brazil, at home in Buenos Aires.
