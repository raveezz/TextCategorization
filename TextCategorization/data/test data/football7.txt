Portugal manager Luis Felipe Scolari's proficiency of the English language is such that it would give a confidence boost to a kindergarten student whose parents' second language is English. Yet, the man at the helm of affairs when Brazil won the 2002 World Cup could rather choose to manage the England national team after the World Cup, when his contract with Portugal ends, rather than be the head honcho of leading Portuguese or Spanish clubs, including Real Madrid, where managerial jobs are up for grabs. 

In late 2002, when Barcelona President Joan Laporta was unhappy with incumbent manager Radomir Antic, Scolari's name was being bandied around as a possible replacement. In early 2003, Scolari gleefully decided that the less glamorous job of national manager of Portugal would put food on his table for the next few years. 

"I am a pure football manager," explained Scolari. "I have coached Brazilian clubs, but I like to concentrate on international football because club management involves combining commercial and technical decisions. My skills lie in spotting and developing talent and that is what motivates me, not managing the transfer budgets." Scolari is the leading representative of a new breed of football managers who choose to specialise in either clubs or country but not both. At the other end of the spectrum are names such as Arsene Wenger, Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho who, ironically, are united in that at some stage or the other they have made public their apathy for international management. 

Though more high-profile managers choose to specialise in club management, Scolari certainly has like-minded people on his side of the managerial divide, the most prominent being Australian manager Guus Hiddink, who managed Holland and, blimey, South Korea to World Cup semifinals in 1998 and 2002.
