England's outgoing manager Sven-Goran Eriksson represents the `obverse' of Hiddink. The Swede has managed clubs such as Lazio successfully — he took the modest Serie `A' club to the league title in 2000 at the expense of giants such as Juventus and AC Milan — before his England stint and it was no secret where his loyalties lay. "I miss club management," said Eriksson even as he was busy ensuring that England qualified for the 2002 World Cup. "It demands a more hands-on approach which is what I like." 

Eriksson, though, was quick to add in a lighter vein that the England job demanded identical skill sets to club management because of the unparalleled media spotlight that comes along with it. As the `fake sheikh' sting operation of tabloid Daily Mirror earlier this year illustrated, Eriksson has always been nursing ambitions to return to club management and his trusted lieutenant, England captain David Beckham, might well help him get the job at Real Madrid after the World Cup. 

Italy's current and previous managers, Marcello Lippi and Giovanni Trapattoni, have had exceptionally successful managerial stints with Serie `A' giants. While Trapattoni, who was in the job between Euro 2000 and 2004 including the World Cup in Korea and Japan, made no bones about his preference for clubs, Lippi has a more balanced view which subtly gravitates towards international football. "In the international game, you see the players only for a week once every couple of months. For all of that, you have the privilege of working with a highly motivated group and the country's most talented players, which gives you the opportunity to build something special," said Lippi recently. "It is therefore essential to be flexible and not just stubbornly pick the players who fit in with your favourite formation and personal view of how football should be played. Big clubs in Italy, or anywhere else, are afraid of ending up in mid table and therefore they stick to stars and established names and don't want to risk fielding young players."
