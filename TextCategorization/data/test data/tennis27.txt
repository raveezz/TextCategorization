The 54-year-old Tanner had already served 10 months jail-time in Germany and the U.S. for other offences. 
Here's a theory as to why some ex-sportsmen and women run into troubles. Circuits and leagues provide organisation, structure, companionship and the need for discipline and training. During their careers, professional athletes have a real sense of mission and purpose. 
Once that's taken away - either by choice through retirement or because of any other reason - people with amazing drive and energy usually find themselves all alone and confronted by a huge void. Will they fill that emptiness in a positive or negative way? 
It's hoped that by the time Bjorn Borg turns 50 in June many of his personal problems will have eased and that he'll be at a much happier place within himself. So far the 21st century hasn't been easy for the man voted Sweden's greatest athlete of the 20th century.

For many players, it is the most challenging time of the year as the clay takes the bite out of the serve and requires greater patience to win points. 
But for the Spaniards and the South Americans, it is like Christmas! 
Andy left Scotland to train outdoors on clay at the Sanchez-Casal Academy in Barcelona when he was 15, and that experience helped him improve his technique because you have to play many more shots.

It also improved his court craft - with more time to hit the ball, shot selection has to be spot on as weak shots are often punished. 
His time in Spain also improved his strength, speed, discipline, consistency and concentration. 
On clay courts balls bounce relatively high and more slowly, making it difficult to hit an outright winner. 
Players have to learn to create openings but must also develop a weapon to finish the point off. 
Clay courts favour aggressive baseliners who are physically strong in both upper and lower body, quick off the mark and mentally tough through long points and long matches. 
The slower bounce allows for bigger back swings which can generate extra power and the higher bounce encourages forehands with semi or full western grips to create heavy topspin. 
 
Why is clay so slow? British players have not been particularly successful on the clay circuit and this has much to do with spending their formative years training on fast indoor surfaces.
