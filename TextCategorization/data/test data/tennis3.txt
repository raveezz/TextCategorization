To avoid giving your opponent an early start toward your drop shot, try to hide your intention as long as possible. If you set up with a short backswing just above the ball well in advance, your opponent can see a dropper coming. The best deception is to start with a longer backswing, then shorten it just before actually swinging. This is especially effective if the preparation looks just like that for your slice drive. You'll often make your opponent think you're going to hit a drop shot, then when he starts forward, you can hit a slice drive right past him.
Notice that the legs have already driven upward: the knees have straightened, and the feet have lifted off the ground. The legs begin the kinetic chain that culminates in the racquet-head speed that delivers spin and power to the ball. 
Elbow up, racquet down. Generally, the longer the racquet's path, the more time it has to build up speed. Dropping the racquet as low as possible maximizes its energy potential as you prepare to whip it upward. 
Body arched, like a bent bow. As the body (bow) straightens, it contributes more energy to the kinetic chain. 
At this link in the kinetic chain, the legs have driven upward, the body bow has straightened, and the shoulder has begun to rotate upward. 
Notice the 90-degree angle between the forearm and the racquet. The wrist is still relaxed, letting the racquet continue to hang downward. The wrist must be the last link in the kinetic chain in order to create the racquet head speed
