Schwarzer made himself a national hero with two saves in a penalty shootout against Uruguay to secure Australia's place in the World Cup finals. Australia had been beaten 1-0 in the first leg of the play-off but won the second in Sydney by the same score to take the tie to penalties. Schwarzer's heroics prompted huge celebrations across the country. It was not the first time he had been a penalty hero, his save from Manchester City's Robbie Fowler on the final day of last season having secured the club's place in the UEFA Cup. 

Moment to forget: 

Middlesbrough's European exploits and Australia's passage to the World Cup have made this a memorable season for Schwarzer, but it has not all been plain sailing. The turn of the year was a tough time for him as he fell out of favour following his transfer request. The affair, at least, spared him the indignity of Boro's 7-0 thrashing by Arsenal, as he was kept on the bench, but he conceded four in a 4-0 home hammering by Aston Villa soon after his return. It was a miserable afternoon for Boro with a fan protesting at the poor display by throwing his season ticket at manager Steve McClaren.
