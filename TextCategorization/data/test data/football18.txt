Managed by Sven-Goran Eriksson since 2000, England's strength indeed is the quality of talent coursing through the team. Yet, despite the talent the team has often failed to gel during needle matches and this should be one of the main causes for concern for both England and its fans in Germany. England, nevertheless, could be expected to qualify for the second stage without raising much of a sweat. 

A fifth Argentina-England match, given the famed rivalries that the two teams have been engaged in, in the past, particularly after Sir Alf Ramsey's off-the-cuff remark referring to the Argentinians as `animals' during the 1966 World Cup, is very much a possibility at the quarterfinal stage in Germany should the two teams get that far. However, such an encounter is certain to be quite different from the 1986 match in Mexico when Maradona almost single-handedly put the Argentinians past the English with his infamous `Hand of God' goal and added another which today is acknowledged as the most spectacular of all goals seen in the World Cup. 

Nevertheless the encounter between the two sides is something a genuine football fan cannot afford to miss.
