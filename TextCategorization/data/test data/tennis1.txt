A drop shot can be a huge weapon. Against opponents who don't run forward well, aren't comfortable at the net, or tire easily, it's devastating, and even the speediest opponent is not immune.
The key ingredients in a good drop shot are shortness, softness, and backspin. Your goal is to get the ball to bounce twice before your opponent can get to it, so it's the shortness of the second bounce that matters most. Having a short first bounce is a good start, but you also need low ball speed and backspin to keep the second bounce as short as possible. The best drop shots actually bounce back toward the net, making the second bounce shorter than the first. 

To create backspin, you must brush down the back of the ball with your strings. Anytime you brush down on the ball, you must also tilt your racquet face upward to compensate and give the ball some lift to go over the net.

For most players, the easiest grip for forehand drop shots is the Eastern forehand, but a Semi-Western grip can work (uncomfortably, given its reluctance to tilt upward), and a Continental grip naturally tilts upward, though often too much if you're not used to it.
