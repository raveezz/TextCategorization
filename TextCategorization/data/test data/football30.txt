Benitez has been patient and loyal with him, picking him in the Champions League final team, giving him a medal and then picking him again this season when a lot of people might have washed their hands of him. Now it's time for him to pay back that loyalty.
Liverpool's squad isn't exactly weak, but I would still plump for United as I think they are stronger. On Tuesday they had Louis Saha and Ji-Sung Park on the bench and the likes of Paul Scholes, Alan Smith and Gabriel Heinze injured. Now that's not bad going in terms of strength in depth.
All that they're really still needing is a real quality central midfielder. Paul Scholes is over 30 while Alan Smith is a converted striker, John O'Shea is a converted defender and Darren Fletcher is lacking experience.
By the way, Fletcher impressed me against Arsenal. He gets a lot of stick but I think a lot of people wanted too much, too soon. It was a great deal to ask of a young player to fill the boots of Roy Keane, and maybe only now is he ready to step up to the next level.
But at the moment he's not that top-quality midfielder that they need to really be a massive influence in the centre of the park - a Patrick Vieira, a Keane, a Steven Gerrard. Obviously those players don't come along every day, but I think they've missed out on the likes of Michael Essien, Michael Ballack and Mark van Bommel in recent months. All those players fit that bill.
I think Sir Alex knows that the next big midfield signing he makes has to be the right one, after failing with Juan Veron, Kleberson and Eric Djemba-Djemba. For me, that is the one giant gaping hole in that squad.
That's why I was a little surprised that their first January signing is a centre-half, where I think they have plenty of cover with Wes Brown, O'Shea and Gary Neville even. But it seems that Mikael Silvestre has fallen out of favour with Sir Alex, and he's targeted a defender's defender, someone not like Rio Ferdinand, who always fancies himself as a footballer.
It will be interesting to see what this new lad is like, along with any signings that Liverpool make, as they battle it out for second place. Thank the lord there's still one kind of battle at that end of the table.
