STORIL: Jie Zheng and Li Na set up the first all-Chinese women's final at the WTA level as both won their semifinal matches at the Estoril Open on Saturday. 

The unlikely pairing of eighth seed Li, who lost the 2005 final to Czech Lucia Safarova, and the sixth-seeded Jie, marks another step forward for the Chinese game. 

Jie upended Italian top seed Flavia Pennetta with a straightforward 6-2, 6-3 victory while Li defeated France's Emilie Loit, winner of the event in 2004, by a 7-5, 6-2 scoreline. 

Clijsters in final 


Meanwhile, Kim Clijsters maintained her domination of Elena Dementieva on Saturday with a 7-5, 6-4 semifinal win at the Warsaw Open, which hands the Belgian her second final of the year.

On Friday, Venus Williams fell 6-4, 6-2 to two-time finalist Svetlana Kuznetsova of Russia in the quarterfinals. Kuznetsova, who finished as runner-up in 2004 and 2005, will now take on Anna Chakvetadze, who defeated Serbia's Ana Ivanovic 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, for a place in the final
