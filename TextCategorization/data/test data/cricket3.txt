Ian Ward, first class opening bat and work-in-progress journalist, did not think to make that point during a television interview and more tongues chattered. 

Three days later I was at a dinner attended by a man soaked in cricket knowledge, by several men on the fringe of county administration and a couple of international athletes. They also wanted to know: What is the Trescothick thing all about? 

I cannot give you anything but guess work. I believe Trescothick already faced a tough tour as the most consistent batsman when he heard that he would have to lead the team in the Test and one-day series as well. He probably had a virus or at least a debilitating cold and then he received bad news from home. 

Whatever that was hardly matters. It was the straw that broke his back and, in the midst of a minor breakdown, he could take no more. He fled. 

As I write he is batting like his old self. Class is permanent, the cricketers love to trumpet, and he will turn on the run machine again soon. But dare England trust him to stay the course, for instance, in Australia next winter? 

Remember, they have the recent example of Graham Thorpe to sway their thinking. Thorpe, who was as much as Trescothick the rock to whom England were moored, left India when his marriage troubles loomed.
