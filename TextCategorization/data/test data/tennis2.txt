For backhand drop shots, a one-handed, Eastern (modified or full) or Continental grip is usually best. Many players tilt too much with the Continental and have more control with the Eastern. Only a very small minority of two-handed backhanders use two hands on the drop shot. 
Start the swing with your racquet roughly a foot higher than and two feet farther back than your intended point of contact. Use a short, gentle motion, angling forward and downward. The amount of tilt in your racquet face must be adjusted for your swing path and speed, but you'll usually tilt back between 30 and 50 degrees. Create the downward motion primarily from your larger muscles, pivoting from the shoulder and elbow more than the wrist and bending your knees as you hit to accentuate the downward path. 

The best way to develop a drop shot is to hit lots of them. Here's a progression that will make the practice fun: 

Get a friend or a pro to feed you balls with each of you at your respective service lines. 
Your goal should be to get the ball to pass no more than three feet above the net and bounce at least three times before passing the opposite service line. (A higher ball, no matter how short, would give your opponent too much time in a match situation.) 
Stay at your service line until you hit a drop shot that meets this test. Then, each time you hit a good dropper, take one medium step back. Keep going until you get back to 7/8 of the distance from the net to the baseline. (Trying drop shots from any farther back in a match usually doesn't pay off, because the farther your ball has to travel, the harder it is to hit short and the more time your opponent has to run forward.) 
Refining the Shot and Using it in Matches
If your drop shots are tending to go too high, you need to tilt less, and very likely, you need a more Eastern, less Continental grip, which will naturally orient the racquet in a more vertical plane.
If your drop shots are landing too deep, you need to meet the ball more softly.
