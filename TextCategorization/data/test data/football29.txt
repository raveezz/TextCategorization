Like a long-distance runner in fifth place, Arsenal need to forget about who's way ahead in first, second or third and just target who's in front of them. Closing the gap to Tottenham has to be their priority now - pass them and then worry about what Man United or Liverpool are doing when fourth is in the bag.
They are now 11 points behind second-placed United. In another season I would not say that gap was insurmountable. But there's been no sign that Arsenal are capable of winning ten games on the bounce as we've seen them do in previous seasons.
Their away form is terrible and their home form is not holding up against the top teams. I think if they were offered a guaranteed fourth place right now they would take it.
So that leaves us with a battle between United and Liverpool for second - unfortunately I think we all know who will be champions, which does seem ridiculous at the turn of the year, but that's the reality. I still fancy United despite the fact that Liverpool have certainly impressed me this season.
The difference between this Liverpool and last season's Liverpool is consistency. That's the easy answer - but how did they get that consistency? I think it's come from trust in the manager. He's got them believing in him and themselves, which was not necessarily there last season. They know he's in total control and they trust him with that control.
It helps that the spine of the team is playing so well - Jose Reina, Jamie Carragher, Sami Hyypia, Xabi Alonso and of course Steven Gerrard. The rest of the team might chop and change but those five players are pretty much constant and playing at a very, very high standard. As long as they continue to do that, the results will keep coming.
They've been quite fortunate in that Carragher and Hyypia have stayed fit, because they started the season with no cover for them. That has to be the priority in the January transfer window, and I've no doubt we'll see at least one central defender signing on at Anfield despite their recent form at the back.
Harry Kewell could save them spending their money on a left-sided player if he carries on the path towards being something like the footballer we saw at Leeds - the footballer that was talented, threatening, scored goals and created goals. He hasn't come close to that at Liverpool and he owes them big time.
