1986 Quarterfinals: 

France 1 Brazil 1 (at ET; 

France won 4-3 on penalties) 

France overcame their 1982 disappointment by winning the 1984 European Championships in style, and their confrontation with Brazil in Mexico was a pulsating contest between two teams loaded with flair players. 

Careca blasted in the first goal after a typically smart move but France equalised when a Rocheteau cross from the right eluded both France striker Yannick Stopyra and Brazil goalkeeper Carlos and Michel Platini tapped into an empty net. Substitute Zico had the chance to win it from the penalty spot but his effort was saved by Joel Bats. That miss ultimately resulted in a shoot-out, which despite a miss from the inspirational Platini, France won to set up another semifinal meeting with West Germany. 

1994 Second Round: 

Romania 3 Argentina 2 

The introduction of three points for a win meant the 1994 finals were far more exciting in the early stages than the 1990 edition of the tournament in Italy. But arguably the best game of the competition came in the second round in front of over 90,000 fans in the Rose Bowl, Pasadena. Ilie Dumitrescu and Gheorghe Hagi provided Romania's inspiration, the former sealing a move to Tottenham on the strength of his displays at USA `94 which included a brace against the South Americans.

Though placed in different pools, a fifth Argentina- England match is very much a possibility at the QUARTERFINAL STAGE in Germany. The encounter between the two sides is something a genuine football fan cannot afford to miss, writes A. VINOD.
