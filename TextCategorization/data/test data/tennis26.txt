His post-tennis life saw problems with drugs, an apparent suicide attempt (denied by Borg) and a failed marriage with an Italian singer. He made a disastrous comeback in 1991 - using his old-style wooden racquets - and retired again in 1993, failing to win any of his ATP matches. 
To raise funds later in the 1990s, Borg joined the Seniors' tour and that's where I met him in August 1997 at Colorado Springs in the United States. 
It was the Nuveen Seniors Circuit and Borg lined up alongside his old rivals and former Grand Slam title winners, John McEnroe, Jimmy Connors and Yannick Noah. 
The press launch was held on a sparkling summer's day and I remember the four great players posing together like members of a rock band, with the stunning backdrop of a mountain resort and country club. 
McEnroe was his usual chirpy and caustic self, Connors was in his "I'm amazing for my age" mode while Noah was all French cool, smiling and playing with his kids. Borg just seemed happy to be around his former tour foes - he also looked extremely fit and wiry - but remained typically quiet and introspective. 
That weekend, McEnroe and Borg played an incredible match on the Broadmoor courts at Colorado Springs. For a few, magical minutes, it was as if time had compressed and we were witnessing a capsule from that epic 1980 Wimbledon final, won 8-6 in the fifth set by Borg. 
All Borg's troubles seemed to have vanished as he hit those familiar topspin forehands and two-fisted backhands from the baseline, showing amazing speed and agility (at the time he was 41). 
On that day in the mountain air, McEnroe prevailed in a tight match. Even nine years later, we've seen that the American left-hander can still compete at a high level - in February, at the age of 47, he combined with Swede Jonas Bjorkman to win the ATP doubles titles at the SAP Open in San Jose. 
At least Borg's post-tennis life hasn't declined to the extent of Roscoe Tanner, another Grand Slam singles champion from the 1970s. 
Tanner, winner of the 1977 Australian Open, is serving a two-year prison sentence for violating terms of his probation, related to failing to pay for a $35,000 boat. Embarrassingly, he was arrested on court during a tennis tournament in Europe.
