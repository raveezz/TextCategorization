This horrendous run culminated in that hugely embarrassing 7-0 defeat to Arsenal on Saturday. And it could have been even more. I don't care what anyone says about the team they put out that day, they had enough experience on that pitch to avoid that kind of humiliation. It wasn't so much that they were beaten by a better team, it's the scale of the capitulation that will worry Boro fans.
Thankfully for Steve McClaren they cleared the obstacle of Nuneaton on Tuesday night and that was a hugely important win. If they'd lost you could probably have expected him to walk away.
Steve will learn a lot about himself as a manager and a man in the coming weeks, as this is the first time he has been truly tested. He will learn about his own powers of motivation and his own ability to stand the pressure which has been lacking in almost five years as Boro boss.
He will know that chairman Steve Gibson will give him time just as Bryan Robson was given time, but he will also know that ultimately he will be judged on progression in the league. Robson took Boro to two cup finals but also took them down - Gibson will be looking for a different kind of return from McClaren.
The good news for the club is that it's January and not April, giving them plenty of time to get players fit and to turn things around. It's difficult to know where to start when you're in a run like that, but the old cliches about working hard on the training pitch are old cliches because they're true. All you can do is double your efforts and hope you're rewarded.
But I've been at clubs where there seems to be a new injury every week. You're wondering who's going to be next and thinking that it really must be another club's turn. I don't know what's in the air up there, but it seems that Newcastle are cursed too.
Graeme Souness is being hammered by the fans and the press but I don't think he has been able to put out a full team once this season. 
I saw them at West Brom and although they rode their luck a bit they had Michael Owen scoring goals, Scott Parker and Emre running the midfield and Kieron Dyer coming off the bench to change the game. I remember thinking 'maybe the season starts here'. But since then all those players have been lost to injury.
You have to feel a little bit sorry for them, but hard-luck stories are easy to come by in football. They have been dealt certain cards and those are the ones they must play with - replacing the manager will not change that.
