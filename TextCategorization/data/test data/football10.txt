Strong and independent souls such as Scolari and Hiddink loathe making commercial compromises, which are part of the club manager's daily life. Scolari, for instance, knew that Brazilian legend Romario was not the player he wanted in the squad for the 2002 World Cup, and though there was massive pressure from the football crazy public of the nation he did not select the 1994 World Cup star. Similarly, he substituted public favourite Luis Figo during the second half of Portugal's Euro 2004 quarterfinal against England. Decisions like these would be almost impossible in modern club management; a Real Madrid manager was sacked for leaving Ronaldo on the bench. However, club management too attracts strong-minded managers to it. This is primarily because it gives scope for the manager, in Lippi's words, "to gradually transmit (his) way of thinking to the players, both in terms of football and life." 

This is something which Sir Alex Ferguson loves doing; he recently spelt out his managerial philosophy, hardly an exercise in modesty, thus when talking about Wayne Rooney: "You need young players with an attentive mind who trust the coach and the manager to do the best for them. Wayne gets that at United." 

Ferguson's bete noire Arsene Wenger is drawn to club management because of its internationalism. "Football is not about passports; it is about developing quality performers," Wenger, who has turned down the offer of managing France, said recently in the wake of criticism that the Arsenal side that entered the Champions League final contained only a single Englishman, Sol Campbell, and that too only in the second leg of the semifinal. 

June and early July are when people like Wenger and Ferguson switch off from football. Cruelly, in 1986, Ferguson had to be the ad-hoc manager of Scotland for the Mexico World Cup because of the death of incumbent manager Jock Stein. He prepared by having extensive discussions with Alf Ramsey, the legendary England manager, but Scotland crashed out of the tournament in the first round. One strong-minded individual then decided that international management is not for him come what may.
