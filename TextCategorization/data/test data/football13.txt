1970 Final: 

Brazil 4 Italy 1 

Probably the best final match in World Cup history, featuring a Brazilian side at the peak of their powers. Pele rose to head them in front before some generous defending allowed Roberto Boninsegna to equalise for the Azzurri. From that point on though it was all Brazil. Gerson blasted in from long range to make it 2-1, Jairzinho kept up his record of scoring in every match in the finals despite making a hash of his finish, but the best was saved until last. 

A sweeping team move culminated in an effortlessly brilliant pass from Pele, weighted perfectly into the run of right-back Carlos Alberto who cracked in a low shot. 

1982 Second Group Phase: 

Italy 3 Brazil 2 

Italy had made a sluggish start to their campaign and reached the second group stage with three first-round draws, but Paolo Rossi inspired them to this famous victory. His first came when the Brazilian defence failed to track him at a set-piece, but the South Americans hit back swiftly when Socrates slotted a shot past Dino Zoff in Italy's goal. 

A poor pass from Toninho Cerezo gave Rossi an easy chance for his second, but Brazil showed backbone as Falcao blasted in a second equaliser from outside the box. But Rossi — back in the side after serving a ban for his part in a betting scandal — would not be denied and swivelled to add the decisive touch to a Marco Tardelli shot.
