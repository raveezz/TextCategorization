1966 Final: 

England 4 West Germany 2 

England's finest two hours in football got off to an inauspicious start when a poor Ray Wilson header put a chance on a plate for Helmut Haller. The hosts roared back with a Geoff Hurst header and a scrambled Martin Peters goal and were seconds from glory when a free-kick caused confusion in the box and Wolfgang Weber equalised. "You've beaten them once, go out and beat them again," Sir Alf Ramsey told his players, and inspired by the tireless running of Alan Ball England scored twice more. Hurst's first effort has been the source of controversy ever since over whether his shot crossed the line after bouncing down off the underside of the crossbar, while his second, late in the added period, was defined by Kenneth Wolstenholme's immortal commentary: "Some people are on the pitch, they think it's all over. It is now." 

1970 First Round Group Match: 

Brazil 1 England 0 (at ET) 

The reigning champions came up against a Brazil side poised for greatness in a titanic struggle played out in intense heat in Guadalajara, Mexico. 

Both sides had excellent chances — Jeff Astle missing a glorious opening for England, while it took one of the greatest saves of all time from Gordon Banks to claw out Pele's powerful downward header. A patient move climaxed with Jairzinho scoring the only goal, and the famous photograph of Pele and Bobby Moore swapping shirts at the end encapsulated the mutual respect between the teams. 

1970 Semifinals: 

Italy 4 West Germany 3 (at ET) 

West Germany gained revenge on England by coming from two down to beat them 3-2 in the quarterfinals, but this last-four clash looked set to be a routine win for Italy thanks to Roberto Boninsegna's early goal. However, a 90th-minute strike from Karl-Heinz Schnellinger took the match to extra-time. Suddenly the game burst to life as Gerd Muller edged the Germans ahead but by half-time of the added period Italy were 3-2 in front thanks to Tarcisio Burgnich and Gigi Riva. Muller drew his side level again in the 110th minute, as Franz Beckenbauer battled on with a broken collarbone and the momentum was with Germany again. However, Gianni Rivera had other ideas and side-footed what proved to be the winner seconds later.
