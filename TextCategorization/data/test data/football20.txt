NEW DELHI: The All India Football Federation (AIFF) has forwarded a list of 11 coaches to its Technical Committee for consideration for the post of the chief coach of the Indian team. 

In a release on Saturday, the AIFF General Secretary, Alberto Colaco, said that the coaches selected by the Technical Committee would be called for discussions with the committee here before the end of this month. 

Michel Hidalgo of France, one of the big names mentioned by the AIFF earlier, had not responded after an initial query through his agent and he was yet to quote his price or to forward the rest of the conditions. Thus he does not figure in the short-listed 11. 

However, Hidalgo, the former French National coach, might yet be considered if he approached the AIFF within the next two weeks, Mr. Colaco said. The Technical Committee is expected to select five or six coaches out of the list of 11 and place them in order of its priority by next week. The selected coaches would then be called for interviews here on May 24 and 25. 

Of the 11 being considered now, Jorge Mario Olguin had played for the World Cup winning Argentine team in 1978, Milos Hrstic of Croatia had figured in the Yugoslav World Cup team 1982, Brian Kerr had been Ireland's National coach, Clemence Westerhof of Holland had been coach of PSV Eindhoven and Nigeria, Ian Porterfield had once coached Chelsea and Colwyn Rowe had been Technical Director of the England youth team. 

The other five coaches are: Bob Haughton (England), Milton Queiroz da Paixao (Brazil), Roy Maicol Barreto (Portugal), Predarg Juka (Croatia) and Amir Alagic (Bosnia).
