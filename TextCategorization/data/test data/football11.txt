World Cup is known for the excitement and the passion it generates world over. Here are some of the CLASSIC ENCOUNTERS that reinforce the tournament's status as the biggest sporting event on the planet.  




1938 First Round: 

Brazil 6 Poland 5 

Brazil were well-equipped to become the first side to win the World Cup on the `other' continent when they arrived in France, with Leonidas the brightest star at the competition. He grabbed the first of 11 goals in an incredible match in Strasbourg's Meinau Stadium. The game finished 4-4 after 90 minutes and by the end of the added period Leonidas had scored a hat-trick and team-mate Peracio had two. Poor Ernest Wilimowski had hit four, but Poland were out of the tournament. 

As for Brazil, they decided to rest Leonidas for their semifinal against Italy in readiness for the final. But the South Americans never made it and in pre-substitute days the star striker looked on as his team lost 2-1. 

1954 Final: 

West Germany 3 Hungary 2 

A Ferenc Puskas-inspired Hungary had hammered the Germans 8-3 in the first phase and were expected to waltz to World Cup glory in Berne. 

Puskas suffered an ankle injury in his side's quarterfinal victory over Brazil and looked far short of fitness, but nevertheless another drubbing looked on the cards as the Magic Magyars raced into a 2-0 lead inside eight minutes. Ten minutes later though Germany were back on level terms thanks to goals from Max Morlock and Helmut Rahn, and the latter scored the winner six minutes from time to seal one of the World Cup's great shocks.
