ENGLAND NEEDS Marcus Trescothick but the team also needs a guarantee that he is fully committed to the cause. 

It's a great pity, but before we can begin what is likely to be called The Burnt-Out Ashes series, this summer will have to include a long debate on the merits of Marcus Trescothick. 

That only goes to show what happens when public relations types decide to indulge in what the House of Commons calls terminologically inexact and the rest of us call lies. 

On many occasions I have been sitting in press briefings, media conferences and off the record chats and wondered: Why do they do it? 

I guess an unexpected event causes a moment of panic, there is the need for an explanation and telling a porky pie appears easier than reaching for the truth. 

Remember the case of Shane Warne and Mark Waugh, revealed as having consorted with bookmakers, which was covered up by ICC and the Australian authorities? I wondered then what they had hidden before that made them think they would get away with this deception. The naughtiness never remains buried and when it all comes tumbling out the perpetrators look very foolish indeed. Let me just remind you what happened in Baroda three months ago. Trescothick, who had just been appointed captain because Michael Vaughan was going home to cure his knee troubles, batted twice in that match for a total of 50 runs. When he came out for the second time there was a phone call waiting for him. 

No one seems to know what was said but by the end of the call Trescothick, as placid a guy as you can meet, was in tears. It appears that at that moment he decided he needed to go home and before you could say, "Batsmen are greedy, bowlers are lazy," he was on a plane for Heathrow. 

Just as quickly, Duncan Fletcher told the press — who were naturally curious about a team who had already lost Vaughan, Ashley Giles and Simon Jones — that Trescothick had a personal problem and asked them to respect his privacy.
