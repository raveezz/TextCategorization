Hiddink, though, is more complicated a case study than Scolari. The Dutchman has a long history of managing high-profile European clubs, dating back to winning the European Cup — the precursor of the Champions League — in 1988 with PSV Eindhoven. He returned to PSV in 2003, after his revolutionary stint with Korea, but his contract with the club left little to the imagination of football pundits as to where his heart lay. Hiddink took up the job only after inserting a clause in his contract that he would be allowed to combine national management with his job at PSV. 

In July 2005, two months after his young PSV team gave a scare to AC Milan in the Champions League semifinal, Hiddink became the new Australian manager with the country facing a tough double-legged World Cup Qualifier Play-off against Uruguay in November in order to enter its first World Cup since 1974, also in Germany. 

"Managing a country in the World Cup is the ultimate experience," said Hiddink, who was successful in his mission when Australia defeated the Latin Americans in the penalty shoot-out in the second leg in Sydney. "I'll never forget the love I got from the public in Korea. The Australian public is sports mad, and I realise I carry a great responsibility on my shoulders." For the play-offs, Hiddink took a break from PSV only during the international weeks. "Because most of the Australian players play in Europe, and I had seen them play, talent spotting was not a problem. This helped me to do justice to both jobs." Hiddink, whose club has already won the Dutch league, will organise a training camp for his Australian squad in Europe after the club season is over. The Dutchman has announced that he will not be in either of his two jobs after the World Cup; he has already pledged his future as the manager of the Russian national team to help the country qualify for Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup.
