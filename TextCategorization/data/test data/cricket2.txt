Some newspapers did send reporters to his house in Taunton. The cricket writers were baffled but they kept their distance. I have spent too much of my time since telling friends I don't know why Trescothick went home and I may tell you I have received some curious looks of disbelief. 

I knew someone would provide an answer to why Trescothick has failed to display the spirit of Eddie Paynter. 

Paynter left his hospital bed to bat for England in the Bodyline series; Trescothick left his team to fight on without him. Of course the result was that Andrew Flintoff took charge to such an effect that the Test series was drawn against all the odds. 

What happened in the one-day series was purely the result of the devastating injury problems England suffered. I refuse to take any notice of those matches. 

The scales were too heavily weighted in India's favour. 

Anyway, the kindly English reporters left Trescothick alone to sort out what they assumed to be marital concerns and when the team returned home it was all forgotten. 

Sadly, the public relations people stuck their oar in again and left Trescothick to claim he had been suffering from a virus. Once more the loudest protest was from the ghost of Mr. Paynter. 

I used to train young journalists and I can tell you I would have been annoyed if one of those 16-year-olds had failed to ask Trescothick about the contrast between his "virus" and the ECB's tale of "personal problems."
