
World Cup participations: 13 (1930, 1934, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002).

Argentina reached the final in their first World Cup in 1930, losing 2-4 to Uruguay. Between 1929 and 1959, it won the Copa America 12 times (overall, Argentina has won it 14 times) but success eluded them in the FIFA World Cup until 1978. Playing on home soil, Argentina lifted the World Cup for the first time when Mario Kempes scored twice in a memorable final against Holland. Argentina repeated the feat in 1986, thanks to the genius of Diego Maradona and could have won a back-to-back title in 1990 but for an Andreas Brehme penalty that sealed victory for Germany in the final.

World Cup participations: 11 (1950, 1954, 1958, 1962, 1966, 1970, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1998, 2002).

England, the cradle of the modern game, took part in the World Cup for the first time in 1950. Its glory, however, came in 1966 when it was crowned champion for the only time after the Bobby Moore-led squad scored a 4-2 win over Germany in the final, that was marked by a Geoff Hurst hat-trick. 

Since then, England has not progressed beyond the semifinals. 

In 1990 in Italy, it reached the semifinals, but was eliminated by eventual champions Germany in a nerve-wracking penalty shootout.
