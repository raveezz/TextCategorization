In Germany, Argentina's campaign is most likely to be spearheaded by the likes of Juan Roman Riquelme, Javier Mascherano, Javier Saviola and Luis Gonzalez in the company of the experienced Juan Pablo Sorin, Pablo Aimar, Roberto Ayala and Hernan Crespo. And there is already a lot of expectation from the young Lionel Messi, who now plays for FC Barcelona. The young wizard is already seen as a successor to the great Maradona and there is tremendous pressure on Pekerman to include this gifted player in the Germany-bound Argentina squad. 

Despite having an array of talented players, Argentina would be able to make an impact in Germany only if it is able to overcome its inconsistent form and some worryingly indifferent performances away from home. Also by the time the team reaches Germany, Pekerman would also be expected to find an ideal line-up, especially since the side suffers from a surfeit of players competing for the same position. He would also have to define a system that should help counter his team's shortcomings in the absence of a top-class goalkeeper. 

England, as usual, was all fuss before it booked its berth to Germany from Group 6 of the European qualifiers. Incredibly enough, the team still oozes talent and could be the side to watch if it gets itself into its winning ways. And leading the way should be the prodigiously gifted Wayne Rooney. He is the player England looks to for inspiration. 

Rooney is not the only world-class talent in the side that also boasts players of the calibre of Michael Owen and the midfield trio of David Beckham, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. In defence too, England is quite strong with John Terry waiting in the wings to prove his class at the world stage alongside the established duo of Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell.
