For example if the ball hits a clay court at 108 km/h it will typically bounce up at a speed of 64km/h. This is only 59% of its initial speed, making it a good deal slower than on acrylic (hard) or grass courts. 
But the crushed brick also allows players to slide across the surface. It acts like ball bearings between the hard under layer and the player's shoe. 
THE EFFECT ON THE BALL
Spanish clay court players are renowned for playing shots with heavy top As a result the ball kicks up high and many shots are played at shoulder height making it difficult to hit winners. 
 You aren't going to hit any winners unless you're a brutal hitter of the ball

BBC tennis commentator Andrew Castle says: "You can see the spin coming off the opposition's racquet on clay so if it's sliced, it's going to stay low, if it's top spin it's going to kick up. Spin is exaggerated. 
"But clay can change a great deal. If you've just had a bit or rain and the surface is a bit moist the balls will pick up water and they'll be come heavy. 
"That slows the ball down even more making it very hard to hit winners. 
"On the other hand if it's hot and sunny and you've got a nice dusty court then the ball will zip through like a harder surface. 
"So you need to be flexible and patient on clay. Sometimes you need to grind it out. You aren't going to hit any winners unless you're a brutal hitter of the ball." 
THE EFFECT ON THE PLAYER
The high looping ground strokes you see on clay give players time to reposition themselves during a rally which are often 10-15 strokes in duration. 
This hands an advantage to players with incredible power endurance - the ability to repeat short bursts of power over a long period of time.
