But it is a fantastic teacher. If you have access to clay, be sure to use it as much as possible. 
On clay, topspin will kick up, forcing your opponent to hit difficult shoulder-height balls, hence the requirement for upper body strength. 
In addition, sliced shots will really dig in; perfect for drawing your opponent up the court and for keeping the ball low, which makes it really tough for those players with western grips. 
 
Drop shots and short angled slices work well on clay 
Patience and control are key areas on clay too. 
You need to hit lots of cross-court shots to try to take your opponents off the court and create an opening for a winner. 
And you may have to hit many shots before you get the right chance to win the point. 
So it is important you practise drills which involve at least six shots. 
You must also practise changing the pace and depth of a shot, in order to disrupt your opponent's rhythm and try to take them off the baseline position. 
Clay-courters tend to play in a semi circle about 5-10 feet behind the baseline. 
 
Murray's counter-attacking tactics This allows them time to get deep and wide shots back, though possibly leaving themselves vulnerable to the drop shot and the short angled shots. 
So loopy deep balls, short angled slices, short angled topspins and drop shots are good weapons to have in the locker. 
And remember, it is also a good idea to link shots to set your tactics
So use a loopy deep ball to the backhand, followed by a cross-court drive volley. 
Or try a loopy deep ball, followed by a drop shot to the opposite corner. 
Other combinations that work are: 
•  Short to mid-court angle, followed by a deep ball behind the opponent. 
•  Cross-court forehand, followed by an inside-out forehand or cross-court backhand. 
•  Drop shot, followed by a topspin lob or passing shot 
Clay is as natural a surface as you are going to get in tennis. It comes from naturally formed rock which is sometimes processed. 
At Roland Garros the surface is made up of natural clay covered with crushed brick as a fine surface dressing. 
It is this layer that gives the ball extra grip when it hits the deck, making the surface characteristically slow.
