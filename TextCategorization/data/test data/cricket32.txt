The conquest of those demons was aided by the emergence of a younger core of players unscarred by pitiful failures. Against Sri Lanka at Pune in the fourth match of the series, India slipped to 180 for 6, needing another 82 for victory. Dhoni had only the unheralded Suresh Raina for company, but the two ran the fielders ragged as they eased to the target. Dhoni's batting that day was a revelation, with attacking instincts fettered till the very last, when two joyous sixes finished things off. 
That adaptability has made him one of the most feared batsmen in the world. "His temperament and personality are incredible," says Chappell. "A few months ago, he was just a basher. Now he's one of the best finishers, and can also bat up the order. We can depend on him to finesse an innings, batting like [Michael] Bevan used to. But he also has the big shots that Bevan didn't have." 
Dhoni has also had a huge role to play in Project Allrounder. JP Yadav was tried briefly at the start of the season, but instead of casting the net wide into the domestic circuit, the team management then looked within. Irfan Pathan's batting in Tests had caught the eye because of his ability to play impressively straight while packing a mighty punch, and the decision to use him as a floater in the batting order has worked a treat. Similarly, Yuvraj and Sachin Tendulkar - until the shoulder became too painful - were encouraged to work on their bowling. 
The faith reposed has been more than repaid. Pathan has made vital incisions with the new ball in virtually every game, and contributed immensely with his clean hitting when sent up the order. Yuvraj, apart from metamorphosing into a model of consistency with the bat, has also delivered the odd telling spell with the ball, while continuing to pull off sensational catches at point. 
It hasn't happened overnight, and the skeptics have had a field day dissecting and mocking some of the training drills used. "What the hell are they doing?" was a common refrain as players negotiated obstacle courses and other innovations not seen before at cricket training. "What we were doing was developing areas that needed work," says Chappell. "One thing we identified quickly was that we weren't fit enough, mentally or physically, to last 50 overs. Leg strength was something that needed improving. Agility, bending and twisting, was another. Indians are not as naturally athletic as some other races, so we devised some drills aimed at "tricking" them into getting better. We spent months seemingly punishing these guys, and having to explain to them why it was needed."
