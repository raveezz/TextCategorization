A good way to practice a softer touch is to toss balls up in the air and try to catch them on your strings without any bounce. Start with small tosses of two feet or so and gradually work your way up to around eight feet. If you get to the point where you can catch a ball silently from eight feet up, try catching balls on your strings that are fed around waist-high, gently, by a partner around 16 feet away. Feed the ball back to your partner the same way. This game of "catch" is difficult, but fun.

Certain conditions enhance the effectiveness of drop shots: 

softer surfaces like clay and grass 
wind blowing from your opponent's side toward yours 
colder temperatures, which reduce the ball's bounce 
A drop shot is especially valuable against the steady baseliner -- the one who hardly ever misses a groundstroke from the backcourt. Sponsored Links
