The high looping ground strokes you see on clay give players time to reposition themselves during a rally which are often 10-15 strokes in duration. 
This hands an advantage to players with incredible power endurance - the ability to repeat short bursts of power over a long period of time. 
 
Guillermo Coria has perfect footwork for the clay court 
But quick and nimble players like Guillermo Coria have the advantage according to Castle. 
"The big deal on clay is your footwork," he says. "The movement is different because you must time your slide which can be anything up to two metres. 
"Of course if you don't slide at all you can't get back to cover the court and you'll be out of position. It can be the difference between winning and losing a point. 
"Many players use an open stance and often your foot is planted on the floor
because of the loose nature of the surface. You really need to be flexible in your movement and quick adjustment." 
Champions on other surfaces have struggled to get their tactics right on clay. 
Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Boris Becker and Pete Sampras are all linked by the fact they never won the French Open. 
Andre Agassi however managed to buck the trend by taking the ball early and keeping his opponent on the back foot.

"There's no surface which takes a drop shot better. You need to work every rally before you can open up the court for a winner. 
"It's a real art form to be a good clay court player. That's why in general clay-courters don't usually win hard court tournaments." 
player is three years from his use-by date, set for when his elder daughter goes to school and becomes unable to travel. Although there are younger players coming through, the number is not impressive. Tim Henman, the skinny lad who was not expected to make the world's top 200 players, let alone the top six, has agreed to be interviewed to promote an initiative by Procter & Gamble, one of his sponsors, to get children into the sport.
Unusually for a big corporation, this is an ambitious effort for the public good, in which 40% of the budget for promoting a soap powder is to be spent supporting tennis, including a search for talent. Every 7- to 10-year-old, even if they have never held a racket, is being invited to test their speed, balance and co-ordination at an Ariel Tennis Ace day to see if they have the potential to be a champion. The roadshow was in Manchester yesterday, is in Bristol today, and goes next to Ipswich, Southampton, Glasgow and Edinburgh. Free coaching and the chance to train at Wimbledon are on offer.
